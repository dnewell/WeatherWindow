## Synopsis
<br>
Weather Window is an end user appliacation that provides current, short-term, and long-term weather forcasts for a desired location.  All of this information is then displayed to the user in its beautiful, world-class graphic-user-interface (GUI).
	
All of Weather Window's weather information is sourced from openweathermap.org's free [API](http://openweathermap.org/), and then gathered using the [JSON library](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjavajsonjar.htm) of functions.  To generate sky condition icons for the current, short, and long-term forcasts, [ow-font](http://websygen.github.io/owfont/) pack was used.  [Ow-font](http://websygen.github.io/owfont/) is a custom font pack designed to match it's font icon images to all weather ids returned by OpenWeatherMap.  Font packs [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and 
[Weather-Icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) were also used.
